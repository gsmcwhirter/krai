You can probably get away with dropping Krai.php and the Krai directory into the
php include path somewhere (like the pear lib directory, for instance), and
generating an application skeleton with the "-p" flag (see ./script/newapp.sh -h).

Otherwise, you can use the framework in the same directory as your application.


Dependency:
  - The Krai_Mail component of the framework depends on the PEAR Mail library
  - The Demo Application depends on the PEAR Text_Wiki library

Please see the README file for complete details.
