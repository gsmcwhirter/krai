You can probably get away with dropping Krai.php and the Krai directory into the
php include path somewhere (like the pear lib directory, for instance), and
generating an application skeleton with the "-p" flag (see ./script/newapp.sh -h).

Otherwise, you can use the framework in the same directory as your application.

Please see the README file for complete details.
