Krai Framework is a MVC-inspired framework. The main concept is modularity.
Modules are individual units of an appliation. The modules hold together
some actions, which are the elements that are executed on a typical page
request. Both modules and actions provide before- and after-filter capability,
and both can hold various other methods. Actions proceed in the pattern
Validate - Process - Display, and everything in the action and the module is
available to the rendering call (whether as an instance method or through
$this->_parent for things in the module).

== DEPENDENCIES ==

- Krai_Mail depends on the PEAR Mail library
- The Demo Application depends on the PEAR Text_Wiki library

== SETUP / USAGE - Blank Application Skeleton ==
Note: The scripts don't seem to work on Mac OS X without some editing.

1. tar xzf krai-XXXXX.tar.gz (you probably already did this if you are reading
    the README file)
2. ./krai-XXXXX/script/newapp.sh [-l] [-p] -d /path/to/application/place -n appname
3. cd /path/to/application/place/appname
4. Edit includes/configs/krai.yml to the correct settings
5. Edit public/.htaccess to correct the RewriteBase (if necessary)
6. ln -s /path/to/application/place/appname/public/ /path/to/public_html/appname
7. Visit http://example.com/appname/ (should see "Yay! Online!)

This is a bare outline. Far more things are possible, though not nearly well
documented yet. Try setting up the demo application and seeing how it works for
an example (see below).

== SETUP / USAGE - Demo Application ==

1. tar xzf krai-XXXXX.tar.gz (you probably already did this if you are reading
    the README file)
2. ./krai-XXXXX/script/newapp.sh [-l] [-p] -w -d /path/to/application/place -n appname
3. cd /path/to/application/place/appname
4. Create a database and import sql/schema.sql
5. Edit the users table entry for "root" to have a valid e-mail address
6. Edit includes/configs/krai.yml to the correct settings
7. Edit includes/configs/application.config.php to the correct settings
8. Edit public/.htaccess to correct the RewriteBase (if necessary)
9. ln -s /path/to/application/place/appname/public/ /path/to/public_html/appname
10. Visit http://example.com/appname/
11. Try logging in with username: root, password: default
12. The demo application should be running.

== BUGS / REQUESTS ==

Please file an Issue at http://krai.googlecode.com if you find any bugs
or if you would like to request any new features.

== COMPONENT GENERATOR ==

There is a component generator script in the script directory of each
application. Call it to see usage. It generates empty files in the right places,
but may eventually add code into those files.
